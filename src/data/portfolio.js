    prosora: `"Prosora" - my digital Journal for a peek into aspects of life which I would like to share in this world just in a more controlled way. In today's world, Internet has become so integral part of our lives that having an online presence has become a necessity. Being from a school of thought wherein I have always liked to keep my life a bit private this becomes a challenge but as they say change is the only constant in this world and hence, while social media presence is important this is my attempt to keep an online Journal for the professional life and also as a means to propagate my story in my way. Also, I have always liked to start from scratch and this is part of my attempt to be introduced in this world with a website created from scratch along with content and design styles which I wish to evolve and hence, keep my learning process going in this evolving and tech centric world. So, Welcome to intro to my world and do connect in case you want I would love to have a chat or suggest if you have any feedback. I just crave for them always :)`,
    
    story: `Hi, I am Akash Yadav a simple, small town boy from Kota (Rajasthan) and an engineer who graduated from IIT Bombay in 2018 with big dreams. Since start it was never about becoming something but rather learning whatever is offered and more specifically how systems and processes work basically from a bird eye view. Coming from a small town life was always slow and hence, focus and inclination was and has always been into learning the way things work with natural curiosity and never about the job to be done to achieve a certain goal. Over years growing up going to college and working this "way" has been tested and off-course as you grow you learn somewhere and I have grown too to be balanced. So inline with this way and so much buzz of "Product & AI" in the world my attention has shifted towards the "tech products and product management" as a whole which is inline with my obsession around bird eye view, balance, customer centricity and age old curiosity of "how it's done" especially the term "Mini CEO" which I have always looked for considering how I want to look at things at work and responsibilities I want to take over. I am sure it will keep evolving I hope I find people who can support me in my curious journey as they always have luckily. :)

So at that note, thank you so much for reading this much and I would be delighted to connect for opportunities, interesting discussions, some side projects, just casual chat or if I can be of help to you in any way. If possible, I would be more than happy to help. Cheers!!`
