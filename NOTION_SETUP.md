# Notion Blog Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Notion Integration
1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name it "Portfolio Blog" 
4. Select your workspace
5. Click "Submit"
6. **Copy the "Internal Integration Token"** - you'll need this!

### Step 2: Create Blog Database in Notion
1. Create a new page in Notion called "Blog Posts"
2. Add a database with these properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| **Title** | Title | Post title (this is automatic) |
| **Status** | Select | Options: Draft, Published |
| **Date** | Date | Publication date |
| **Excerpt** | Text | Short description for previews |
| **Tags** | Multi-select | Categories like "Product Management", "Career" |
| **Featured** | Checkbox | Mark important posts |

### Step 3: Share Database with Integration
1. Click "Share" on your Blog Posts database
2. Click "Invite" 
3. **Scroll down in the invite dialog** - below the suggested contacts, you should see your integrations
4. Look for "Portfolio Blog" with a puzzle piece icon ðŸ§©
5. Click on "Portfolio Blog" to select it
6. Click "Invite"

**If you don't see your integration in the list:**
1. **Try typing in the search box**: Type "Portfolio Blog" (even though it's meant for emails, sometimes it works)
2. **Check workspace**: Make sure you're in the same Notion workspace where you created the integration
3. **Refresh and retry**: Close the invite dialog, refresh the page, and try again
4. **Alternative method**: 
   - Go back to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
   - Click on your "Portfolio Blog" integration
   - Copy the integration ID from the URL or settings
   - Sometimes you can paste this in the search box

**Still not working?** The integration should appear automatically in the invite list. If it doesn't:
- Double-check you completed Step 1 correctly
- Make sure you're the admin of both the integration and the database
- Try creating the integration again with a different name

### Step 4: Get Database ID
1. Open your Blog Posts database
2. Copy the URL - it looks like: `https://notion.so/your-workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...`
3. The DATABASE_ID is the long string of letters/numbers
4. **Copy this DATABASE_ID** - you'll need it!

### Step 5: Add to Your Portfolio
Add these to your environment variables (in Vercel or `.env` file):

```bash
VITE_NOTION_TOKEN=your_integration_token_here
VITE_NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
```
